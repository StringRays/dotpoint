# Worksheet Generator

*My partner is a special education teacher, and I am building this so that she can generate printable worksheets for her classroom. It generates worksheets using numbers with added circles. Solid circles symbolize one, and hollow circles symbolize two. This adds extra information to the numbers and has been useful especially for multi-sensory learners.*

## To Do

- write instruction page
- make menu/close buttons highlightable
- make subtraction, division, and multiplication problems
- make form component for allowing more customizable problem sets
- remove the symbols page that I had there mainly for development
- use a pdf rendering library to get more control over printable layout
## Notes

- Currently not mobile friendly at all (other than navbar) - this is a choice, because for now the use case is simply to print worksheets, not view or complete them online.
